a space where I can work out solutions to the openai requests for research. 

## First Task, Cart-Pole many different ways

setting up the cart pole problem and solving it, first with a dot product with weighted sum, then with hill climbing, then 
with a policy gradient method. 

This request for research was already solved by kevin frans and I used their blog post to implement the solution in my own environment
https://kvfrans.com/simple-algoritms-for-solving-cartpole/

So this was more of an 'imitation learning' approach, and I should look for ways to develop my own strategies for additional problems. However, 
since I was struggling with even the term 'weighted sum' at the first time I approached this and thought that taking the sign of the weighted sum
was more akin to creating a linear regression problem out of the weights and observations rather than just a vector dot product, I clearly needed some
guidance just as an outsider to some of the math and statistics approaches, I'm backing up into that.

these tests were were done with python version == 3.9.5
